# uon-robotics-project

## To Do:

* Object avoidance behaviour (moving around an object) - take a look at the kinematics section of Intro to Autonomous Robots (https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nottingham/reader.action?docID=3339191) there should be a precise solution to this somewhere
* Test/implement subsumption architecture
* Sensor calibration
