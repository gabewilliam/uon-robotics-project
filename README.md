# uon-robotics-project

## To Do:

* Object avoidance behaviour (moving around an object) - take a look at the kinematics section of Intro to Autonomous Robots (https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nottingham/reader.action?docID=3339191) there should be a precise solution to this somewhere
* Full PID control (currently only have the 'P', need ID!) https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/Robotics/RoboticsResources/ROBOTC%20-%20Improved%20Movement.pdf
* Test/implement subsumption architecture
